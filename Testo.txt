The assignment consists on the prediction of default payments using a neural network. 

The dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. 

The provided data comprises the training set that can be used for the training (and eventually for the validation) and the unlabelled test set.



In order to be evaluated, each student should submit:

the source code;
a brief report (1 or 2 pages) with some motivations about the choices on the data processing, the number and dimension of the layers, the activation functions and the loss functions;
(optional) a txt file, where each line corresponds to the prediction (0/1 class) of the instances of the test set.
Collaboration is allowed, but the final product must be individual.

After the deadline, the name of the student with the highest classification performance evaluated on the submitted results will be announced.
